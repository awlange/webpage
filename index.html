                            As part of my dissertation, I studied excited electrons in DNA using quantum chemistry simulations.
                            The red-blue blob here is a depiction of how the three dimensional
                            wave (or, orbital) of an electron spreads out between two adenine molecules when it is excited by
                            ultraviolet light. The red and blue indicates the phase of the electron wave. The adenine
                            dimer is somewhat hidden by the orbital, but the dimer is in the stacking geometry found in biological DNA
                            and surrounded by water, serving as a model to understand electronic excitation in solvated DNA.

                            This is an equation I discovered
                            to model continuum electrostatics of salty solvents characterized by a Debye screening length
                            and a dielectric constant.

                            I called the equation the "Debye-H&uuml;ckel-like Screening Model" (DESMO).
                            It generalizes the classic Debye-H&uuml;ckel model&mdash;a point charge centered in a spherical
                            solute cavity surrounded by solvent continuum&mdash;to arbitrary charge densities and solute cavities.
                            DESMO reduces to the more familiar "Conductor-like Screening Model" (COSMO) in the limit of zero
                            salt concentration. DESMO is a simple, fast approximation to much more complicated models.

                            This is a schematic of the Fragment Molecular Orbital Multi-state Reactive Molecular Dynamics (FMO-MS-RMD) model.
                            It's a clever idea I had to combine Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory with
                            Prof. Greg Voth's Multi-state Empirical Valence Bond (MS-EVB) theory.
                            FMO divides a molecular system into some
                            set of smaller fragments, but this division can be ambiguous in chemically reactive systems.
                            MS-EVB theory deals exactly with that issue by assuming a linear combination of reactive states,
                            like what is shown in the schematic here.
                        </p>
                        <p class="justify">
                            Combining MS-EVB and FMO together results in a new powerful
                            model, FMO-MS-RMD, which incorporates quantum electronic structure theory into the MS-EVB approach.
                            Futhermore, because the states and the molecular fragments can be calculated independently,
                            FMO-MS-RMD can be computed in parallel to achieve considerable speedups.

                            I am writing a parallel JavaScript math and statistics library built around HTML5
                            Web Workers and the Node.js cluster library.
                            The project is called MathWorkersJS, and it's open-source.
                            MathWorkersJS is my personal hobby project I'm doing for fun but also to potentially
                            make a useful tool for the web community.
                        </p>
                        <p class="justify">
                            The motivation behind MathWorkersJS is to introduce some degree of
                            multi-core parallelism into JavaScript mathematical computations, whether
                            they are client-side/in-browser or server-side.
                            While other good JavaScript math libraries exist, none (as far as I know)
                            seem to take advantage of the fairly new feature of HTML5 to
                            spawn Web Workers to help with CPU intensive computations.
                            There seems to be a similar void for parallelism in Node.js with these libraries, too.
                            That's where MathWorkersJS comes in.
                        </p>
                        <p class="justify">
                            So far in tests,
                            I have been able to demonstrate 2-3x speedups with 4 workers for some common
                            linear algebra operations, like matrix-matrix multiplies.
                            More to come in the future!

                            a portion of the full data stored on disk. We use multiple rings to

                            as well as providing data analysis using Cassandra.
                            For instance, the data arrives to the system from various sources
                            (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, web, mobile, offline), and
                            clients would ideally like a complete view of all these channels in real time.
                            The solution I helped to create is a dynamic network of client user data
                            (drawn here in blue and green)
                            stored on Cassandra via the Java web app. This feature is the engine
                            behind much of the new product development at Signal.

                            The molecule shown here is part of an implicit solvent
                            calculation based on a parallel fast multipole method, which
                            runs faster when atoms belonging to a given node are spatially close to each
                            other and also far away from atoms belonging to other nodes. The fitness function for the
                            genetic algorithm reflects that, and it also tends to ensure that no nodes have
                            far more/less work than other nodes.

                            The molecule depicted is a single stranded DNA polyadenine, and each sphere represents an atom.
                            Spheres are colored by which node is responsible for its computation.
                            (There are 4 nodes in this example.)
                            The run starts with a randomized distribution of the atoms across the 4 nodes,
                            which is essentially the worst load balance.
                            Remarkably, the genetic algorithm finds a solution
                            that is very close to the ideal solution for this system.

                            My primary focus as a postdoc was to improve the scalability of a code on
                            the 4th fastest supercomputer in the world (at the time), Mira,
                            the Blue Gene/Q machine at Argonne National Laboratory Leadership Computing Facility.

                            I managed to do this well for a specialized molecular dynamics code used to simulate proton transport.
                            The original code scaled to only about 64 nodes, but I turned it into one
                            that scales to 24,576 nodes (393,216 cores). To achieve this, I built up a replica exchange external driver to
                            the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS, exposed some untapped parallelism in the multi-state proton transport calculations,
                            multithreaded several compute-intensive loops, and did plenty of other little code optimizations. I also managed to
                            contribute a handful of lines of code to the open-source LAMMPS software during this time.
